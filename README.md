# country-blocker-wp
PD Country Blocker is a WordPress plugin that restricts access based on the visitorâ€™s country. It allows you to block the entire site from specified countries, hide specific content (by ID or slug), and define country-specific rules for selective blocking. If no redirect page is set, it displays an informative access restriction message.
