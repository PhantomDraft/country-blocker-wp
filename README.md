PD Country Blocker is designed to restrict access to your entire website or individual pages based on the visitor’s country. Its main features include:

- **Global Blocking by Country:**  
  The plugin allows you to specify a list of countries from which access is denied. If a visitor’s country matches one on the list, they are redirected to a designated page, or, if no redirect page is set, they receive an access restriction message.

- **Blocking by Specific Content:**  
  You can also define individual rules for specific content (by ID or slug), enabling selective content hiding.

- **Country-Specific Rules:**  
  In the settings, you can add a multi-line field where you specify a content identifier and a country code for each rule. When both the content and the visitor’s country match the rule, blocking is applied only for users from that country.

- **Informative Message:**  
  If no redirect page is configured, the plugin displays a detailed message that includes the visitor’s IP address and country.

Thus, the plugin provides a flexible, configurable mechanism for geographic access restriction, allowing administrators to precisely control content visibility.
